  Introduction
----------------

Surrogafier is a 3 tier web proxy with other various features.  The next section
describes how to install and operate this proxy.

  I. How to Operate this Application
--------------------------------------

    I.a: Installation
  ---------------------

Copy the PHP file into a directory that Apache  or any other PHP enabled web
server (with PHP installed and enabled on it), then access it as you would any
other PHP script on said server.

    I.b: Blocking Addresses
  ---------------------------

Edit the PHP file with your editor of choice, and at the top is an array with
the addresses you want blocked as elements.  Currently you can block addresses
in one of three ways:

  1.2.3.4     - plain IP address
  1.2.3.4/24  - subnet blocking
  php.net     - domain blocking

The default blocked addresses are:
  10.0.0.0/24
  172.0.0.0/24
  192.168.0/16
  127.0.0.0/24

These are blocked by default since they are reserved for local
and internal purposes.  If I have missed some, or if I have one
of these mistaken, please email me.

    I.c: Using Surrogafier
  --------------------------

To use the script, just enter the URL you want to send through the proxy, enter
in a proxy ip/port if you wish, and change all the other options to fit your
needs, and click "Surrogafy".  Most sites should work flawlessly with this web
proxy, but if a site does not work, please report it to brad@bcable.net.

    I.d: But Wait...
  --------------------

Q: ... That's it?
A: Yeah, that's it... but just a few notes.  I have noticed a few installs of
   Surrogafier being installed on the firewalled computer of a network, then
   not being successful at getting around the firewall.  The idea is that you
   put Surrogafier on a server free of filtering, then connect to that server to
   bypass the firewall you are under.  Basically, the operators of said network
   must not have any filtering going on, AND the server must not reside in
   China.  You may access a server with Surrogafier installed on it while you
   are residing in a place such as China to bypass the oppressive firewall.
