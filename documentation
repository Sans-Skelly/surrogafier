  Introduction

Surrogafier is a 3 tier web proxy with other various features.  The next section
describes how to install and operate this proxy.

  I. How to Operate this Application
--------------------------------------

    I.a: Installation
  ---------------------

Copy the PHP file into a directory that Apache  or any other PHP enabled web
server (with PHP installed and enabled on it), then access it as you would any
other PHP script on said server.


    I.b: Server Side Configuration
  ----------------------------------

If there is something you are wanting to change about the proxy, chances are
there is a configuration option that can do it for you.  If everything is hunky
dory to you, then you can skip this section.

To see the configuration options, edit the PHP file with your editor of choice,
and at the top there is a series of configuration options you can edit.  These
configuration options are described in detail below.

I.b.i: Basic Config

  DEFAULT_SIMPLE         - Default to simple mode when the page is loaded.
                           (default value: false)

  FORCE_SIMPLE           - Force the page to always be in simple mode
                           (no advanced mode option).
                           (default value: false)

  SIMPLE_MODE_URLWIDTH   - Width for the URL box when in simple mode
                           (CSS "width" attribute).
                           (default value: 300px)

  DEFAULT_TUNNEL_PIP     - Default value for tunnel server.
                           (default value: null string)

  DEFAULT_TUNNEL_PPORT   - Default value for tunnel port.
                           (default value: null string)

  FORCE_DEFAULT_TUNNEL   - Should the tunnel fields be displayed? "false" value
                           here will force the defaults above, disallowing user
                           input.
                           (default value: true)

  DEFAULT_URL_FORM       - Default value for "Persistent URL" checkbox.
                           (default value: true)

  DEFAULT_REMOVE_COOKIES - Default value for "Remove Cookies" checkbox.
                           (default value: false)

  DEFAULT_REMOVE_REFERER - Default value for "Remove Referer Field" checkbox.
                           (default value: false)

  DEFAULT_REMOVE_SCRIPTS - Default value for "Remove Scripts" checkbox.
                           (default value: false)

  DEFAULT_REMOVE_OBJECTS - Default value for "Remove Objects" checkbox.
                           (default value: false)

  DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_URLS   - Default value for "Encrypt URLs" checkbox.
                           (default value: false)

  DEFAULT_ENCRYPT_COOKS  - Default value for "Encrypt Cookies" checkbox.
                           (default value: false)

  blocked_addresses      - Formats for address blocking are as follows:
                             1.2.3.4     - plain IP address
                             1.0.0.0/16  - subnet blocking
                             1.0/16      - subnet blocking
                             1/8         - subnet blocking
                             php.net     - domain blocking

                           The default blocked addresses are:
                             '10/8','172/8','192.168/16','127/8','169.254/16'

                           These are blocked by default since they are reserved
                           for local and internal purposes.  If I have missed
                           some, or if I have one of these mistaken, please
                           email me.

                           For information on the format of arrays in PHP,

I.b.ii: Advanced Config

The following options alter the way documents are parsed on the page, and how
the internals of the script actually function.

ONLY EDIT THIS STUFF IF YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

  MAXIMUM_URL_LENGTH - 500 is the most reasonable number I could come up with
                       as a maximum URL length limit.  I ran into a 1200+
                       character long URL once and it nearly melted the
                       processor on my laptop trying to parse it.  Honestly,
                       who needs this long of a URL anyway?
                       (default value: 500)

  TIME_LIMIT         - Time limit in seconds for a single request and parse.
                       (default value: 10)

  DNS_CACHE_EXPIRE   - Time limit in minutes for a DNS entry to be kept in the
                       cache.
                       (default value: 10)

  GZIP_PROXY_USER    - Use gzip (if possible) to compress the connection
                       between the proxy and the user
                       (less bandwidth, more CPU).
                       (default value: false)

  GZIP_PROXY_SERVER  - Use gzip (if possible) to compress the connection
                       between the proxy and the server
                       (less bandwidth, more CPU).
                       (default value: false)

  PROTO              - Protocol that proxy is running on.  Uncomment this line
                       to define it manually.  If you leave this line
                       commented, the code detects if you are running on an
                       HTTPS connection.  If you are, then 'https' is used as
                       the PROTO value, otherwise 'http' is used.  If you need
                       a different value here, then define it.
                       (default value: undefined)


    I.c: Using Surrogafier
  --------------------------

To use the script, just enter the URL you want to send through the proxy, enter
in a proxy ip/port if you wish, and change all the other options to fit your
needs, and click "Surrogafy".  Most sites should work flawlessly with this web
proxy, but if a site does not work, please report it in the Surrogafier "Bugs"
forum, or email me at brad@bcable.net.


    I.d: But Wait...
  --------------------

Q: ... That's it?
A: Yeah, that's it... but just a few notes.  I have noticed a few installs of
   Surrogafier being installed on the firewalled computer of a network, then
   not being successful at getting around the firewall.  The idea is that you
   put Surrogafier on a server free of filtering, then connect to that server to
   bypass the firewall you are under.  Basically, the operators of said network
   must not have any filtering going on, AND the server must not reside in
   China or any other country which censors its population.  You may access a
   server with Surrogafier installed on it while you are residing in a place
   such as China to bypass the oppressive firewall.
